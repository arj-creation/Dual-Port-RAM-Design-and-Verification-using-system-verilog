# Dual-Port-RAM-Design-and-Verification-using-system-verilog

## Description:
- This project involves the design and verification of a Dual Port RAM (DPRAM) using SystemVerilog. The design is aimed at demonstrating how a Dual Port RAM operates, with two independent ports for reading and writing data simultaneously. This project includes both the RTL design for the Dual Port RAM and the corresponding verification environment to test its functionality.

## Features

- **Dual Port RAM Design**: The main module implements a Dual Port RAM with independent read and write operations.
- **SystemVerilog Testbench**: A comprehensive verification environment built in SystemVerilog to test the functionality of the Dual Port RAM.
- **Test Scenarios**: Includes tests for basic read/write operations, read-after-write, and edge cases such as simultaneous reads and writes to different ports.
